                                <p>The word, brand, derives from its original and current meaning as a firebrand, a
                                    burning
                                    piece of wood. That word comes from the Old High German, brinnan and Old English
                                    byrnan,
                                    biernan, and brinnan via Middle English as birnan and brond.[11] Torches were used
                                    to
                                    indelibly mark items such as furniture and pottery, and to permanently burn
                                    identifying
                                    marks into the skin of slaves and livestock. Later the firebrands were replaced with
                                    branding irons. </p>

                                <p> The marks themselves took on the term and came to be closely associated with

                                    products. Through that association, the term eventually acquired its current
                                    meaning. </p>

                                <p> Branding and labeling have an ancient history. Branding probably began with the

                                    of
                                    branding livestock to deter theft. Images of the branding of cattle occur in ancient
                                    Egyptian tombs dating to around 2,700 BCE </p>

                            The organizing of information could be seen since humans began to write. Prior to that,
                            history
                            was passed down only through song and word.[citation needed] As can be seen with religion,
                            books
                            and spoken word, science (through journals and studies) organizing not only is history but
                            also
                            supports the communication of history.
